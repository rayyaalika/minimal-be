# Interview Task: Login API and CRUD Service

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to our interview task.

This project is designed as an interview task, where the goal is to build a **Login API** and a basic **CRUD service**. It uses **Vite - Node.js** for frontend and can be run with **Yarn** or **npm**.

Please follow the instructions below to set up the project.

Frontend: https://github.com/ptpl-source/starter-pack-interview-fe

Backend: https://github.com/ptpl-source/starter-pack-interview-be

> For backend API, you can explore using **Golang, NodeJS or Python**. Feel free to use and explore using those Backend Language.

# Important:

**Time Acknowledge**: After cloning the repository, you must send an email after 3 days for both FE & BE repo from your github link to the following recipients: kuncoro.baroto@pertamina.com, ahmad.saparhadi@pertamina.com
and sopian.iskandar@pertamina.com

Here is a summary of the steps the candidate must follow to complete the task:

## Task Summary

You are required to create a **backend API** using either **Golang** or **Node.js**. This API will handle **login** authentication and a **CRUD service**. The provided project contains only the **frontend**, which will interact with your backend API.

### Step 1: Clone and Setup the Frontend

1. **Clone this repository** clone it locally.
2. **Install dependencies** using your preferable language either, golang, python or nodejs.

### Step 2: Build the Backend API

You will need to build a separate backend API using **Golang** or **Node.js**.

1. **Create a Login API**:
   - Implement a `POST /login` route to handle user authentication.
   - Use **JWT** for authentication.
   - Upon successful login, return a JWT token.

2. **Create a CRUD Service**:
   - Implement a basic CRUD service to manage resources (e.g., `Tasks`, `Products`, or `Notes`).
   - CRUD routes example:
     - `GET /items`: Retrieve all items.
     - `POST /items`: Create a new item.
     - `PUT /items/:id`: Update an existing item.
     - `DELETE /items/:id`: Delete an item by ID.
   - Secure these routes with JWT to allow only authenticated users to perform CRUD operations.

3. **Deploy your backend API** (optional but recommended) using a service like Heroku, Vercel, or any cloud provider.

### Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend API

1. Update this **frontend** to interact with your backend API for the login and CRUD services.
2. Use the backend APIâ€™s **JWT** token to protect the CRUD routes on the frontend.

### Step 4: Documentation

1. Provide basic **API documentation** (either using Postman, Swagger, or a simple Markdown file).
2. Include instructions on how to run the backend locally and how to test the login and CRUD endpoints.

This summary outlines the key tasks, including backend API creation, securing routes with JWT, and integrating the frontend with the backend API.
